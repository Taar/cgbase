I stumbled upon g'base while looking through old 5.25 inch diskettes I acquired and after loading it up, I was intrigued by how simple the software was. So much so that I probably would have used it back in the day.

**g'BASE, the database management system** was designed to be used with the C64 and C128. The diskette is labeled as part of the "HOME MANAGEMENT SERIES - LOAD'N'GO SOFTWARE" developed by Green Valley Publishing (A division of ShareData, Inc).

This repository is my attempt to recreate the software using C within the same storage and memory constraints that were available at the time. This is repository will not contain a dump of the original software nor will it be feature compatible. I also will not be using the original source to help build the C version. I am going to add new features and tweak the design a bit to work better with modern terminals. With that said, this software is not intended to be ran on the C64 even though there are ways to [cross compile C using llvm-mos](https://www.c64-wiki.com/wiki/llvm-mos). Maybe in the future I will attempt something like that :)
